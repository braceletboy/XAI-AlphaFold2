Applications
============

ProDy comes with two sets of applications that automate structural dynamics
and sequence coevolution analysis:


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :glob:

   prody/index
   evol/index



On Linux, when installing ProDy from source, application scripts are placed
into a default folder that is included in :envvar:`PATH` environment variable,
e.g. :file:`/usr/local/bin/`.

On Windows, installer places the scripts into the :file:`Scripts` folder under
Python distribution folder, e.g. :file:`C:\\Python27\\Scripts`.  You may need
to add this path to :envvar:`PATH` environment variable yourself.
